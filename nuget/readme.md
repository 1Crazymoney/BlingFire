# Bling Fire Nuget package for C#

Note: this is still work in progress, we might have to change file names, locations and APIs.

This folder contains nuget package sources for the Bling Fire Tokenizer wrapper code. It also includes native DLLs and binary files.

To test C# code use the following commands:

0. one time install dotnet framework, see this link for Linux: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu
1. cd BlingFire/nuget/test
2. dotnet run -- BlingUtilsTest

This will compile and run the small test program.
